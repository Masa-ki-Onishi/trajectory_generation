AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS:
You must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.
You are, however, able to call any of the following Python functions, if required, as often as you want:
1. inverse_kinematics(px, py, pz, pp) -> None : This function takes the coordinates of px, py, and pz and the pitch angle of pp, calculates the angle of each motor using inverse kinematics, and executes it. The units for the coordinates are meters.
2. forward_kinematics(angle1, angle2, angle3, angle4) -> None : This function returns nothing, it does it by inputting the angle of each motor.angle2, angle3, and angle4 can only rotate from 95° to -95°.
3. open_manipulater() -> None: This function will open the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.
4. close_manipulater() -> None: This function will close the gripper on the robot arm, and will also not return anything.
5. task_completed() -> None: Call this function only when the task has been completed. This function will also not return anything.This function must be called whenever a task is completed.
When calling any of the functions, make sure to stop generation after each function call and wait for it to be executed, before calling another function and continuing with your plan.angle2, angle3, and angle4 can only rotate from 95° to -95°.

ENVIRONMENT SET-UP:
The 3D coordinate system of the environment is as follows:
1. The x-axis is in the vertical direction, increasing upwards.
2. The y-axis is in the horizontal direction, increasing to the right.
3. The z-axis is in the depth direction, increasing away from you.
The origin is set to 0.
The robot arm end-effector is currently positioned at [INSERT EE POSITION], with the pitch value at 0, and the gripper open, and the angle of each motor is [INSERT EE ANGLE].
The robot arm uses 4 motors and has (x, y, z) coordinates and pitch angle degrees of freedom.
The rotation values should be in degree.
Negative rotation values represent clockwise rotation, and positive rotation values represent anticlockwise rotation. angle2, angle3, and angle4 can only rotate from 95° to -95°.
The left side from your point of view is the one where the y-axis value increases.
The right side is the one where the y-axis value decreases as seen from you.


OBJECT:
1. there is a bottle at coordinates (0, 0.2, 0.28).
2. there is a cube at coordinates (0, -0.12, 0.2).
3. There is a cup at coordinates (0, 0.05, 0.35).
4. There is a flat table at x-coordinate 0.03.
Please generate a trajectory to avoid collision with the desk.


COLLISION AVOIDANCE:
If the task requires interaction with multiple objects:
1. Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that an object does not collide with another object or with the tabletop, unless necessary.
2. It may help to generate additional trajectories and add specific waypoints (calculated from the given OBJECT information) to clear objects and the tabletop and avoid collisions, if necessary.


CODE GENERATION:
When generating the code for the trajectory, do the following:
1. Describe briefly the shape of the motion trajectory required to complete the task.
2. The trajectory could be broken down into multiple steps. In that case, each trajectory step (at default speed) should contain at least 50 points. Define general functions which can be reused for the different trajectory steps whenever possible, but make sure to define new functions whenever a new motion is required. Output a step-by-step reasoning before generating the code.
3. If the trajectory is broken down into multiple steps, make sure to chain them such that the start point of trajectory_2 is the same as the end point of trajectory_1 and so on, to ensure a smooth overall trajectory. Call the forward_kinematics or inverse_kinematics function after each trajectory step.
4. When defining the functions, specify the required parameters, and document them clearly in the code. Make sure to include the orientation parameter.
5. If you want to print the calculated value of a variable to use later, make sure to use the print function to three decimal places, instead of simply writing the variable name. Do not print any of the trajectory variables, since the output will be too long.
6. Be sure to call the task_completed function when the task is completed.
7. Mark any code clearly with the ```python and ``` tags.

###Instruction###
The user command is "[INSERT TASK]".
#################

"""
"""
The user command "ちょっと左です" translates to "a little to the left". This means that the robot arm should move a little to the left from its current position. 

The current position of the robot arm end-effector is at [0, 0.15, 0.28], with the pitch value at 0. 

To move a little to the left, we will increase the y-coordinate slightly. Let's say we increase it by 0.05. The new position will be [0, 0.2, 0.28], with the pitch value still at 0.

We will use the inverse_kinematics function to calculate the new angles for the motors and move the robot arm to the new position.

Here is the Python code to execute this command:

```python
# Move a little to the left
inverse_kinematics(0, 0.2, 0.28, 0)
```

After the robot arm has moved to the new position, we will call the task_completed function to indicate that the task has been completed.

```python
# Indicate that the task has been completed
task_completed()
```

So, the complete Python code to execute the user command "ちょっと左です" is:

```python
# Move a little to the left
inverse_kinematics(0, 0.2, 0.28, 0)

# Indicate that the task has been completed
task_completed()
```
